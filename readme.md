See [here](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs) for details of LFCS Certification.

In addition to covering the LFCS content, this Certification Path also aligns with the [Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam) objectives.
